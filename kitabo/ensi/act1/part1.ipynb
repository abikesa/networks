    "_Static & Dynamic_. Jung and Freud each explored the terrain and cyclical rhythms of the mind, offering complementary perspectives rather than conflicting doctrines. As Nietzsche warned, \"One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil. And why, then, should you not pluck at my laurels? You respect me; but how if one day your respect should tumble? Take care that a falling statue does not strike you dead! You had not yet sought yourselves when you found me. Thus do all believers — Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have all denied me will I return to you.\" (Quoted by Jung to Freud, 1912). This interplay of teacher and pupil underscores the evolution of their ideas as dynamic and iterative rather than static. Source: Harley Therapy Ltd. © 2006-2024. All rights reserved.
